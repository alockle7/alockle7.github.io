#Am I a Data Scientist?

This blog aims to answer the following questions...

-What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
-What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
-What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
-How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Are my code blocks working?

Data scientists study structured data, which is quantitative data like numbers and dates, and unstructured data, which includes words, images and videos.
  Structured data ED visits, heat indices. Unstructured data like triage notes and chief complaints

Similarities
1. Data scientists and statisticians both collect and interpret data. Both might design models. Both use statistical methods to answer questions and tell a story about the data.


Differences
1. Data scientists may use statistics. Statisticians might design surveys. Data scientists focus on technology, whereas statisticians focus on math and data collection.

I see myself as more of a data scientist. One of my current tasks involves automating the forecast for our heat alerts using data from a NWS API.
