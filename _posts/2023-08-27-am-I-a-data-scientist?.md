# Am I a Data Scientist?

*This blog answers the following questions...*

- What do I think being a data scientist is about?  
- What do I see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
- What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
- How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I think a data scientist is someone that uses data to inform real-world decisions. I view myself as a data scientist becuase I study structured data, like heat illness diagnosis codes, and unstructured data like triage notes and chief complaints. I use syndromic surveillance data for heat illness to publish weekly statewide heat illness reports. I want to develop my data science skills so I can create heat vulnerability indices by overlapping social vulnerability data, and heat illness rates by census tract. I believe that it is my duty as an epidemiologist and a data scientist to develop heat safety programs that benefit the populations most vulnerable against heat illness. 

Some similarities between data scientists and statisticians are that they both collect and interpret data, might design models and they both use statistical methods to answer questions and tell a story about the data.

I think the difference between data science and statitistics is nebulous, data scientists may use statistics and statisticians may use data science. Both are likely to use some form of a programming language. One difference might be that data scientists focus on data manipulation and visualization, whereas statisticians focus on math and data collection.

I see myself as more of a data scientist.I am not as comfortable when it comes to statistical language so I hope that I can develop my statistics skills in this course.
