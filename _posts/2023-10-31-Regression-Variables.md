# Selecting Variables for Regression Models


When selecting variables, my first step is to check for collinearity. If there were two exploratory variables with a linear relationship, I would remove at least one of those variables because they are undermining the significance of the actual predictor variables.

In terms of selection methods, I like the simplicity of forward and backwards selection because my decision to add or drop variables is based entirely on the p-values. I also like all-possible subsets because it generates models for all possible combinations of predictor variables.
